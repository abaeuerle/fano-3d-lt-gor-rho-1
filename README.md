Comments:

The number in the column "case" refers to the corresponding case in Proposition 2.24.

The isomorphy type of the class group is presented as [0 t1 ... tn] meaning ZZ + ZZ/t1 ZZ + ... + ZZ/tn ZZ.

"acr" in the fourth to last and third to last column stands for "Anticanonical Ring".

"codim" in the second to last column refers to the codimension of the anticanonical embedding.
